# YouTube Channel Explorer: Categorize Data

### Categorization Model Training
----
Our `trainTestModel` dives deep into a database of previously sponsored YouTube channels. Through machine learning techniques, it learns to categorize new channels into predefined content categories, adapting to the nuances of YouTube's diverse content landscape.

### Categorization Process
----
We apply the trained model to categorize new YouTube channels into one of the four predefined categories:
- **No Related**: Channels that do not fit into the other categories.
- **Cinematic**: Channels specializing in cinematic content creation.
- **Drone Review**: Channels focused on reviewing drone technology and accessories.
- **Freestyle/Racing**: Channels dedicated to drone racing and freestyle flying.
